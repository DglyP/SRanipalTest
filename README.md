The purpose of this project is to investigate whether humans exhibit pupil mimicry when they interact with virtual avatars or robots that have the ability to change the size of their pupils. Pupil size is a crucial social signal that is connected with understanding emotions, and joint emotional responses. This project will examine the evidence for pupil mimicry, discuss if it affects the perception of these entities as human-like, its social effects on humans, and explain its implications for the development of realistic virtual and robotic technologies. Research techniques such as the Godspeed questionnaire, Likert scales, and fixation objects will be used to assess this.
The results of this study may have implications for the development of more realistic virtual humanoids that can better elicit emotional responses and improve the interaction between real and artificial humans. Finally, the study will investigate the role of blinking in analyzing pupil data, as well as the importance of brightness perception and luminance manipulation for pupil research.
